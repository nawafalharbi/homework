THIS IS THE first assignment in data science.

in this assignemtn we get a data from university of califirnia.
The classification task of this database is 
to determine where patients in a postoperative recovery area 
should be sent to next. Because hypothermia is 
a significant concern after surgery
 (Woolery, L. et. al. 1991), 
the attributes correspond roughly to body temperature measurements. 

first we load the data to python. 
then we fundd that most of the data is in type of string. 
we mapped the data from strings to numbers. 
we found that there is three missing variables. 
we predict the missing values by caluculating the median of the features where it has the missing value. 
then we predict the missing values using the median. 
the reason why i choose the median is because the median wil not be affected by the skewed values. 
 


What is 'Statistically Significant'
Statistically significant is the likelihood that a relationship between two or more variables
 is caused by something other than chance. Statistical hypothesis testing is 
used to determine whether the result of a data set is statistically significant. 
This test provides a p-value, representing the probability that random chance could explain the result; in general, 
a p-value of 5% or lower is considered to be statistically significant.
